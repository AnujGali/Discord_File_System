# Discord File System
A full-stack file system project that utilizes Discord as a database. 

# Description 
The file system is designed to resemble file systems like BTRFS and ZFS, and was made with inspiration from my file system class project coded in C. 
User will be able to log in on the website made with React to access their files, where they can upload new files, create new directories, and read and write files. 
Backend receives the data and sets it up to be placed cleanly and efficiently into a Discord server via the discord.py library. 

# Current Status
Successfully set up the file system design and backend, and currently working on designing and coding the frontend

# Future 
The project is mainly intended to improve my full-stack development skills, but I plan on possibly turning it into a note-taking or task management app where students or organizations can make notes and share them with others in a Discord server.
